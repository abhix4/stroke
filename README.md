# Stroke

Animated SVGs drawn by hand.

Stroke lets you draw in a canvas, preview smooth SVG stroke animations, and copy a ready-to-use React component powered by Motion.

Minimal. Visual. Production-ready.

---


## How it works

1. Draw in the canvas
2. Preview the animated SVG
3. Copy the generated component code
4. Paste it into your project
5. Install `motion`
6. Adjust size using `className` and color using `color` props
